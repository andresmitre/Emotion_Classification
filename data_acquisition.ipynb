		"The data collection, starts with a FER(Facial Expression Recognition) using [haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), with a professional camera/webcam. Images were taken while 23 participants watched a series of films related with emotions. The images were saved into separate emotions folders. GSR lectures were recorded as well since stress and boredom emotions stimulates the activity of sweet glands. the GSR were captured with the [Grove - GSR sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GSR-sensor-p-1614.html) and saved into a CSV file. \n",

		"**Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)**\n",
		"\n",
		"The Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) is defined as a change in the electrical properties of the skin. The signal can be used for capturing the autonomic nerve responses as a parameter of the sweat gland function. The measurement is relatively simple, and has a good repeatability. Therefore the GSR measurement can be considered to be a simple and useful tool for examination of the autonomous nervous system function, and especially the peripheral sympathetic system.\n",
