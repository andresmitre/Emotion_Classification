    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. By using a combination of advanced training techniques neural network architectural components, it is now possible to train neural networks of much greater complexity. This course will introduce the student to deep belief neural networks, regularization units (ReLU), convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. High performance computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Deep learning allows a model to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is similar to the function of the human brain. Focus will be primarily upon the application of deep learning, with some introduction to the mathematical foundations of deep learning. Students will use the Python programming language to architect a deep learning model for several of real-world data sets and interpret the results of these networks."

There is very little difference between how a deep neural network is calculated compared with the original neural network.  We've always been able to create and calculate deep neural networks.  A deep neural network is nothing more than a neural network with many layers.  While we've always been able to create/calculate deep neural networks, we've lacked an effective means of training them.  Deep learning provides an efficient means to train deep neural networks.\n",
