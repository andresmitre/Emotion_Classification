# Repository description 

"Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks of much greater complexity. Deep learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain." [[1]](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning)
